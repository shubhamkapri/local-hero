# Local Hero

## Overview
Local Hero is a city-aware AI assistant built for Bharat.  
It understands local culture, Hinglish language, slang, food, transport, and daily city-specific needs.

The app provides local, human-like guidance instead of generic internet answers.

---

## Problem Statement
Most apps and AI assistants give generic responses that do not reflect how real locals think or speak.

People new to a city struggle with:
- Where to eat
- How to travel locally
- What places are actually worth visiting
- Understanding local slang and behavior

---

## Target Users
- College students
- Office commuters
- People new to a city
- Daily local travelers
- Local residents seeking quick advice

---

## Core MVP Features
1. Local chat assistant using Hinglish and city-specific tone
2. City context awareness (popular areas, food, transport habits)
3. Quick local action buttons (Eat, Travel, Shops, Safety)
4. Rule-based local response engine (no ML)

## Out of Scope (MVP)
